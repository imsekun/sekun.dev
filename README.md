# Sekun

This is what I use for stream-related, and potentially work-related matters.

## Get started

1. Install `nodejs`, and `npm`. You can use `nix` to take care of the dependencies.

```bash
# At project root
nix-shell # Creates a new shell environment with all the necessary dependencies.
```

2. If you've made some changes to the stylesheet, you can rebuild the CSS file.

```bash
npm run build:css
```
